# Assignment 3

*Assignment Three - Populating Models*

>As a part of our journey through Django, recent chapters have covered using the Django Admin, which is a very effective and useful tool for working with and managing Models, users, and privileges.
>
>Three Part Series of Assignments
> > We will now embark on a three-part series of assignments where we prepare for working with the WT Schedule so that we can make the degree checklists/curriculum guides. Here are the parts:
> > >Part 1 (This assignment) - Simply add your models to the Django admin and then create some records that reflect the Bachelor of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems program:
> > >https://catalog.wtamu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&poid=4565&returnto=2546.  You want to populate a few representative records.<br>
> > >Part 2 (Next assignment) - Create user-facing forms so that users can create and manage aspects of curriculum via the system.<br>
> > >Part 3 (Subsequent assignment) - export and import data via a specified/dedicated additional module that we wire into the Django Admin
>
>This Assignment
> >Add all models to the Django admin<br>
> >Add in a few records<br>
> >In a separate user-facing view, show a list of all records of each model type using dedicated individual pages or a single page
